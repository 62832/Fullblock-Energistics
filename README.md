# Fullblock Energistics
A relatively small add-on for [Applied Energistics 2](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Energistics-2) that
adds full-block versions of every ME terminal. Includes optional integration with
[ME Requester](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/merequester) to provide a full-block version of the Requester Terminal.
